# WeatherApp

WeatherApp is a simple command-line application written in Java that fetches and displays the current weather information for a specified city using the Weather API. The application also displays ASCII art based on the weather conditions.

## Features

- Fetches current weather data for any city.
- Displays temperature, humidity, and weather description.
- Shows ASCII art corresponding to the weather condition.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Internet connection

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nishit-Nilay/Summer_Projects.git
    cd Summer_Projects/Weather
    ```

2. **Compile the Java source file:**

    ```bash
    javac -cp .:path/to/okhttp.jar:path/to/json.jar com/example/WeatherApp.java
    ```

    Replace `path/to/okhttp.jar` and `path/to/json.jar` with the actual paths to the `okhttp` and `json` library JAR files.

3. **Create an executable shell script (weather.sh):**

    ```bash
    echo '#!/bin/bash' > weather.sh
    echo 'java -cp .:path/to/okhttp.jar:path/to/json.jar com.example.WeatherApp' >> weather.sh
    chmod +x weather.sh
    ```

    Replace `path/to/okhttp.jar` and `path/to/json.jar` with the actual paths to the `okhttp` and `json` library JAR files.

4. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    ./weather.sh
    ```

    Enter the name of the city when prompted to get the current weather information.

## Usage

When you run the `weather.sh` script, the application will prompt you to enter a city name. Type the name of the city and press Enter. The application will fetch and display the weather information along with ASCII art based on the weather conditions. To exit the application, type `quit`.

## Example

Enter a city (or type 'quit' to exit): London
Weather in London:
Temperature: 15.0 Â°C
Humidity: 80%
Description: Partly cloudy
